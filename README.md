## Project Title
**ShapeTransformer**: Transforming Distorted Shapes into Their Closest Real Forms

## Introduction
ShapeTransformer is an innovative tool designed to address the challenge of distorted shapes in images. This project aims to classify distorted shapes into their closest real geometric forms, such as squares, circles, or triangles. If the shape cannot be confidently classified, it remains unchanged. Furthermore, for shapes that are successfully transformed, the tool performs a symmetry check to ensure the transformed shape adheres to geometric symmetry principles. This dual approach of classification and transformation ensures accurate and visually coherent shape representations.

## Details
ShapeTransformer consists of two main components:
1. **Shape Classification**:
   - Uses a machine learning model to classify distorted shapes into predefined geometric categories.
2. **Shape Transformation and Symmetry Check**:
   - Transforms classified shapes into their proper geometric forms.
   - Performs a symmetry check on the transformed shapes to ensure geometric integrity.

- **Frameworks**:
  - TensorFlow/Keras for shape classification.
  - OpenCV for image processing.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Machine learning classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  - Geometric transformation and symmetry analysis.
